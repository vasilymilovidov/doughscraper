# Doughscraper

Doughscraper is a CLI tool for preparing samples for [`tidalcycles/strudel`](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel). It has two modes:
- Detect files with note/octave pairs in their names and rename them, removing everything else. This mode is primarily designed to prepare samples generated by Logic Pro's 'Auto Sampler'.
- Take a folder of samples, detect subfolders with pitched samples using their filenames, detect subfolders with one-shot samples, and generate a JSON file for use with strudel.
- 
The first mode requires a path to the local folder (e.g., 'Users/username/samples').

The second mode requires a path to the local folder and a path to a remote folder where you will upload your samples (e.g., 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vasilymilovidov/samples/main'). 

Do not include the closing backslash in the paths.
